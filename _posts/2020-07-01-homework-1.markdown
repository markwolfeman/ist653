I've released Unit 3 materials and [Homework 1:](https://markwolfeman.github.io/ist653/assignments/homework1.html)

I've split you up into groups of 3, see your name below. Please connect with your partners as soon as possible. You can access people via your group thread on the discussion forum or via Outlook if you have to. There's an address search function on your email. Ask questions and post your completed project in the Homework 1Forum.

I will create Group Threads for you all to discuss in.

**It's due July 4th.** _I urge you to complete this sooner,_ but I'm giving you some leeway beacuse I know you all have jobs and lives outside of school.
