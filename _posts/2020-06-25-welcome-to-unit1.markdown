Hi All,

And welcome to IST 653!  I've posted Unit 1 to the course site. Please watch the posted videos to orient yourself to the course, as well as the presentation video.

There's a "Meet Your Classmates" icebreaker due on Monday, but the sooner you do it, the more time you can get acquainted with fellow collaborators.

If you have any questions, please post them to the Ask A Question forum. Subscribe to the forum too, and it's a good idea to subscribe to all of them as they are created.
