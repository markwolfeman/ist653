Hi All,

I've posted Unit 5. Please read assigned readings and watch the videos, all of which flows into Homework 2, due Monday.

Feel free to work in groups. I will make a discussion board forum, "Homework 2". I don't care if you work alone, as an entire class or break off into groups just as long as all of the comments, questsion and answers get posted in the forum. I ask for help all the time at work, so don't be shy. :-)

Hope everyone is staying cool and sane. The class is picking up speed and will be over with before we know it!
