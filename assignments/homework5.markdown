- Choose 10 images to upload into your repository.
	- These images should reflect the theme you chose for your repository for Homework 4. If you want to change the theme of your repository, now is the time to do so. The project should have some kind of educational mission.  Consider that you might want to send this link to a potential employer.

  - Ensure that all of your images are public, if you see &quot;(Private)&quot;, they need changing.
