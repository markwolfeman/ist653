- [Homework 5 Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8wPB-TenNc&feature=youtu.be) []

**[Part 1]**
- Choose 10 images to upload into your repository.
	- These images should reflect the theme you chose for your repository for Homework 4. If you want to change the theme of your repository, now is the time to do so. The project should have some kind of educational mission.  Consider that you might want to send this link to a potential employer.
	- Using ReNamer normalize your filenames using best practices we've already covered.
 
**[Part 2]**

- Each item will be need to be added, then metadata assigned to it.
  - Add Item, upload image
  - For each image, Assign metadata for Title, Subject, Description, Creator, Date, Rights, Format, Type, and Identifier. 
  - Ensure that all of your images are public, if you see &quot;(Private)&quot;, they need changing.
  - Lastly, Select Users on the navigation bar, and add me as an &quot;Admin&quot; user.

- **Due** 
- This assignment is worth 10 points. 
- Email me the link to your Omeka site, plus id and password, and the .txt file as an attachment. I should also receive a seperate email from Omeka once you add me as a user. 
- You can work in groups and help each other on the discussion board, but you must progress with your *own* Omeka site.
