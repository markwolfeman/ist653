<h1> Homework 5</h1>

- [Homework 5 Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8wPB-TenNc&feature=youtu.be) [12:22]

# Select and prepare content for Omeka collection

- Choose 10 images to upload into your repository.
	- These images should reflect the theme you chose for your repository for Homework 4. If you want to change the theme of your repository, now is the time to do so. The project should have some kind of educational mission. Consider that you might want to send this link to a potential employer.
	- Using ReNamer or by hand, normalize your filenames using best practices.
 - Using the DOS prompt: 
   	- Change drive by merely typing the drive you want to be in and a colon like, <span style="font-family:Courier">C:</span>
   	- Navigate to the folder of images by typing,  <span style="font-family:Courier">CD</span> [path to directory with images] you can copy and paste in the path or enter it by hand.
    - Print out the directory to a .txt file using a series of commands: <span style="font-family:Courier"> dir /b &gt; filenames.txt</span>
    - Copy and paste the file names from the newly created .txt file and past into the <span style="font-family:Courier">indentifier</span> field column of your spreadsheet.

**[Upload using CSV Import Tool or Upload by Hand]**

- Upload using CSV Import tool Option:
	- [Read CSV Inport Tool documentation](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/CSV_Import/)  
	- [Watch video for the CSV Inport Tool](https://vimeo.com/104014678)
- Create your metadata spreadsheet template in the spirit of the one you used in Homework 3, following these guidelines:

	- Ensure that your spreadsheet headings are unique, with no spaces.
   	- If you have a repeating field such as <span style="font-family:Courier">dc_subjec</span> or <span style="font-family:Courier">subject</span> you must create a unique field for subsequent fields, <span style="font-family:Courier">dc_subject1</span> and <span style="font-family:Courier">dc_subject2</span> etc.
    - Step 1, uncheck Automap button. For Item Type, Select &quot;Still Image&quot;, Select a collection to put your items in, and select "Mark All Items Public". Leave remaining options as is.
    - Step 2, map all of your elements to those in Omeka, then click &quot;import CSV File.&quot;
      

 **[Upload by Hand, Assign Metadata Option]**

-	Upload the 10 images and create metadata 
-	Navigate to Items in Omeka, and go through your metadata records and upload associated image.
- Ensure that all of your images are public, if you see &quot;(Private)&quot;, they need changing.
- Each item will be need to be added, then metadata assigned to it. </li>
- I would like the metadata to look similar to this [example .csv file](https://www.albany.edu/~mwolfe/ist653/homework/hw5/example.csv) 
	OR [this completed one](https://www.albany.edu/~mwolfe/ist653/homework/hw5/omeka_metadata_canals.csv)
 - Lastly, Select Users on the navigation bar, and add me as an &quot;Admin&quot; user.
