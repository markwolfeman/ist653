	- look up OCLC code for your assigned college or university, and <u>append</u> to file name: [OCLC Codes for libraries](http://www.oclc.org/contacts/libraries.en.html)
	- <u>change case</u> of file extension from upper to lowercase
	- <u>serialize</u> your file names, add leading zeros for 6 character serial, for example "000001.jpg"
	- <u>make lowercase</u> and <u>remove</u> unconventional characters or spacings
	- <u>append</u> Exif Date, just the year <span style="font-family:Courier">(YYYY)</span>, for example "2001_000001.jpg" to the file name by clicking on <span style="font-family:Courier">Insert Meta Tag</span>, located here: [ReNamer button](https://markwolfeman.github.io/ist653/assignments/insert_meta_tag.JPG)
	- insert your college name i.e., "Bunyan College" into the filename
	- format your file name so it goes from general to particular, left to right, for a final file name that looks like this example "bun_bunyan_college_2001_000001.jpg"
