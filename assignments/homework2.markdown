You've been given a collection of digitized images, but before they go into the repository, you must complete additional actions as part of you digital workflow. You will be using ReNamer, PhotoScape, Excel, and Adobe Bridge to update and manage a small collection of images. These images were shot or scanned by different people for different purposes. The file names must be normalized. The embedded metadata must be added or updated, and exported to a spreadsheet. The images must be resized and watermarked in preparation for deposit into a digital library.

# Part 1 (5 points) Getting Your File Names Ready

- **Using Renamer:**
<a href="" target="_blank"></a>
	- look up OCLC code for your assigned college or university, and <u>append</u> to file name: <a href="http://www.oclc.org/contacts/libraries.en.html" target="_blank">OCLC Codes for libraries</a>
	- <u>change case</u> of file extension from upper to lowercase
	- <u>serialize</u> your file names, add leading zeros for 6 character serial, for example "000001.jpg"
	- <u>make lowercase</u> and <u>remove</u> unconventional characters or spacings
	- <u>append</u> Exif Date, just the year <span style="font-family:Courier">(YYYY)</span>, for example "2001_000001.jpg" to the file name by clicking on <span style="font-family:Courier">Insert Meta Tag</span>, located here: <a href="https://markwolfeman.github.io/ist653/assignments/insert_meta_tag.JPG" target="_blank">ReNamer button</a>
	- insert your college name i.e., "Bunyan College" into the filename
	- format your file name so it goes from general to particular, left to right, for a final file name that looks like this example "bun_bunyan_college_2001_000001.jpg"


- **Update Embedded Metadata using Adobe Bridge and MS Excel:**

	- Using Adobe Bridge, update:
		- <span style="font-family:Courier">File Name (required)</span>
		- <span style="font-family:Courier">Creator-Web URL(s)</span> 
		- <span style="font-family:Courier">Creator City</span>
		- <span style="font-family:Courier">Date Created</span>



	- Per Homework 2 video, install: <a href="https://metadatadeluxe.github.io/" target="_blank">User customizable export-import.</a>This plugin will allow you to export embedded metadata from your images.
	- Click on the Metadata Deluxe on the Adobe Bridge menu 
	- Follow tutorial in Homework 2 video above on how to export to .txt file

	- The .txt/Excel file should look something like this, but with updated file names <a href="https://markwolfeman.github.io/ist653/assignments/completed_text_file.JPG" target="_blank">text file</a> and <a href="https://markwolfeman.github.io/ist653/assignments/completed_text_file_in_excel.JPG" target="_blank">text file in Excel or alternative spreadsheet software</a>
