The objective of this homework is to mark up your assigned images from Homework 2, just five. You will mark them up in XML using Oxygen, and describe them using the Dublin Core metadata standard via the Dublin Core generator. For the subject headings you will consult the Library of Congress subject heading authority, linked below. In Part 2, you will discuss the benefits and challenges of Dublin Core in 300 words, responding to the questions.  


# Part 1 (5 points)
- Omeka's <a href="https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Content/Working_with_Dublin_Core/" target="_blank">"Working with Dublin Core"</a> and
- <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2000/07/16/usageguide/generic.shtml" target="_blank">Dublin Core.org's Generic Examples</a>

- Use 5 of your images from Homework 2 to describe. 
- Download <a href="https://markwolfeman.github.io/ist653/assignments/dc_hw3.xml" target="_blank">xml file</a>Right-click and choose "Save as" to project folder.
- Choose five images that are as different from each other as allowable.

- Use<a href="https://nsteffel.github.io/dublin_core_generator/" target="_blank">Advanced Dublin Core Generator</a>to encode your metadata

- Describe them using the DC fields: Title, Creator, Subject (limit to one), Description, Date and Date Created, Type, Format, and Indentifier (use the filename without format extension)
- Generate XML for each image and cut and paste it into your .xml file. You will have five image records when you are done. <a href="https://markwolfeman.github.io/ist653/assignments/dc_hw3_example.xml" target="_blank">Completed XML file will look like this</a>
- Remember to consult the <a href="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html" target="_blank">Library of Congress Subject headings (LCSH) (new)</a>or the <a href="http://authorities.loc.gov/" target="_blank">older LCSH site</a>for guidance on your subject headings.


# Part 2  (5 points)

- Based on Miller's discussion in Chapter 2 &amp; 7. Discuss in roughly 300 words, using mostly your own words, but a few quotations are fine:
    
	- Why was Dublin Core and MODS created?
	- What are the strengths and weaknesses of using MODS or Dublin Core?
	- Talk about their structure or lack of;
	- Ease or difficulty of implementation;
	- Explain technically some of the features of each, benefits/cost or drawbacks;
	- Why do you think the developers of Omeka have chosen<a href="http://omeka.org/forums/topic/omeka-and-mods-element-set" target="_blank">Dublin Core over MODS?</a>


- It's worth 10 points and due **Monday, October 30th** 
- Submit via email as one .zip file (include .xml, and .doc files). 
- Work in groups and share information on the discussion board--it will go faster!
