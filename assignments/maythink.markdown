- It's a short title for such an  influential paper, what did he mean by it?
- What are some technologies that he predicted that did come true? Give an example, and what are its benefits and/or shortcomings.
- He talks about &quot;indexing&quot;, has this come to past? What's an example of where it has been used?
- With his prediction of the &quot;Memex&quot;, give an example and description of how that has come into being.
- The camera idea must have seemed like science fiction at the time, how has that come to pass?
