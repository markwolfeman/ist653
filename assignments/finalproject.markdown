[Video Overview for Final Project](https://youtu.be/RkGeFUEuW2I) [7:51]

<h1> Final Project</h1>



Using Omeka, you will demonstrate your ability to build a small repository of images using primary and/or secondary sources. Take those images and create a coherent and compelling story through an on-line exhibit.

**Part 1 (15 points) Install Exhibit Builder plugin**

- In your plugin, click Add an Exhibit to build an exhibit that tells a story and/or documents the photos you have uploaded to the repository.
- If you have not already, you can create a collection, and add your images to that collection so they "live" somewhere, but it's not required. But if your images are not associated with a collection, they can still be incorporated in your exhibit.
- Create an image gallery inside your exhibit, and add your images.
- Create 3 pages that include text and images that tell a story ( approximately 250 words for all). Consider the sequence, if there is one, to your pages.

**Part 2 (10 Points) Install Simple Pages plugin**

- Using Simple Pages, you will create several &quot;About&quot; type pages for the site:
- Create a "staffing" page that includes you as a project director and your role, and two other fictitious names, with their job titles and explanation of roles in the project. 
	- The positions and roles should be based on an exemplary digital repository on the web, perhaps one we've already looked at in class.
- Create a "funding" page. Use something like NTA ("National Trust for the Arts") or something similarly fictitious that tells the background of when the project started, funding, other details--check out exemplary sites for inspiration (50 words).
- Create a "links" or "related resources" page, with short descriptions of each link. Link out to three related sources on your project. 

**Part 3 (5 Points) Navigation, Look and Feel and Coherence**

- Omeka affords you navigational and graphical options to make the site fit your vision. Consider these options:  
	- In the Appearance page of your Omeka theme, make useful choices about navigational buttons exposed to the user. 
	- You may designate the landing page (the link you send me), to land on the exhibit or a collection or the main site.  
	- The exhibit might have an alternative Omeka theme assigned to it, different from the main site if you wish. 
	- Which buttons do you want exposed and where? 
	- What do you label the buttons?
 
 **<font color="Blue">***2 points of extra credit***</font>**  Add images of head shots to your staffing pages. The pictures can be fictitious or annoymous in some manner, not unless you are OK with the public viewing them.
