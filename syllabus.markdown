# Units 

The first unit of class will begin **Monday, May 23rd.** Each subsequent unit will be started on the date following the unit number. Each unit of course materials will be released at least three days in advance of the date on the schedule. The due date and time for each homework will be stated when released. 

# Computer

Students must have access to a computer and a high-speed Internet connection, and a technology back-up plan in order to take the course. 

# Group Work

Except for the two tests, all assignments will be group oriented projects. You must help each other to succeed via the discussion tool. Homework 1 is the only assignment that you will not collaborate on class-wide, instead you will have an assigned partner(s). All other group assignments will entail resolving problems together, but everyone will hand in or post their individual assignment. 

# Readings

Readings are due on the Unit day they are listed on the syllabus. For example, it is assumed you will complete Unit 2's Carr (2012) reading by the start or during the early part of Unit 2. Because the class has no "meeting time," you should not use that flexibility to push everything to the very end of the unit. The presentations, exercises, and assignments are created with the assumption that you've already completed the readings. The sooner you begin the week's materials, the more relavant your questions and participation on BlackBoard will be. 

# Discussions & Exercises

The success of this class will be greatly enhanced by active participation from all students. Questions, comments, and useful information for fellow students and the instructor are welcome. 

# Required Software

We will be using several programs during the course, all of which will be available on to download for free. 

# Homeworks & Final Project

Your homeworks will consist of various hands-on assignments as well as written reports. The final project and ALL homeworks will completed as a team-based assigments, but you will hand in individually usally via email.

We use the Discussion tool in Blackboard to facilitate student collaboration and as a venue for asking questions. The group assignments and final project will use the Discussion tool to facilitate assignments. As with any community, the more you put into it, the more you will get in return. 

Hand in assignments on time! Contact me if you cannot meet a deadline, if not, I will mark assignment as a zero. Additionally, students who fall behind will most likely suffer on the following assignments and tests, and ultimately their final grade. You should devote 8-10 hours a unit to the course.

# Tests

You will take two tests. One will be administered via Blackboard and the other via the course site.

# Submission Process

Submit all assignments as directed, it may be in email or on Blackboard. Homework submissions to the instructor should include a subject heading like the following, "IST 653 / Homework 3 submission." Homework will be graded and returned to you via email.

# Disability Support

Reasonable accommodations will be provided for students with documented physical, sensory, systemic, cognitive, learning and psychiatric disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring accommodation in this class, please notify the Director of the Disability Resource Center (Campus Center 137, 442-5490). That office will provide the course instructor with verification of your disability, and will recommend appropriate accommodations.
